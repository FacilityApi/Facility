# Facility API Framework

The Facility API Framework consists of tools, libraries, and specifications that facilitate designing, implementing, documenting, and consuming web APIs.

## Specification

The Facility API Framework centers around the design and use of a [Facility Service Definition (FSD)](docs/Specification.md). An FSD is similar to an [Open API](https://openapis.org/) description, but an FSD is intentionally much simpler. By reducing the feature set, we make it easier to write and use libraries and tools that leverage an FSD. In addition, by converting an FSD to Open API or another competing platform, the tools and libraries written for those platforms can be leveraged as well.

# HttpMethodInfo.ByRouteComparer field

Compares service methods by HTTP route.

```csharp
public static readonly IComparer<HttpMethodInfo> ByRouteComparer;
```

## Remarks

Orders methods by path, then by HTTP method. Critically, it orders potentially ambiguous routes in the order that they should be considered, e.g. `/widgets/query` before `/widgets/{id}`.
